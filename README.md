# FSRewire-client

This application serves as a discovery service for identifying **Microsoft Flight Simulator** host.

## Features

It facilitates unattended connection setup with the SimConnect server from remote devices.

 - **SimConnect Configuration** üìù: Updates the SimConnect configuration to enable remote communication.
 - **Discovery Service** üì¢: Utilizes UDP broadcasting for disseminating connection information.
 - **User Interface** üìá: Offers a minimalistic user interface for monitoring the application's status.
 - **System Tray Integration** üì•: Integrates with the system tray, allowing users to access essential functions conveniently.

## Usage
 1. Execute the compiled binary to launch the FSRewire-client application.
 2. Run Microsoft Flight Simulator alongside.
 3. UDP packets with connection details will be emitted through your local network.
    - The IP address of the host can be retrieved from the packet itself.
    - Datagram content format: `FSR_SMC:{SimConnectPort}` (for example: `FSR_SMC:500`).

## Legend:

#### FSRewire-client (Left Side):
   1. Discovery Service:
      - FSRewire-client acts as a Discovery Service within the local network.
   2. Broadcast Host Information:
      - FSRewire-client periodically broadcasts packets containing host information (IP address, SimConnect port) to the local network.

#### External Software (Right Side):
   3. Receive Host Data:
      - External software listens for broadcasted packets and retrieves the host information (IP address, port) sent by FSRewire-client.
   4. Connect to Host:
      - External software running on another device within the local network attempts to connect to the host announced by FSRewire-client.
